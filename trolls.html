                        <br>Dear Trolls Family,</br>

                        <br>We’re gearing up in what hopes to be another great winter season. As the 2017-18 season begins, Trolls and Avalanche Ski Club will be merging in anticipation of improving and growing the program. Lessons will be provided by our own ski and snowboard instructors which will essentially build a more personalized relationship and create continuity from week to week. We want to make it possible for the kids to have a great memorable ski and snowboard experience - including an improved family experience which encompasses overall convenience and service for the parents.
Also beginning this season, we’re incorporating technology to make the signup process much easier. It will now be done on line at www.avalancheskiclub.com. The advantage will be that credit cards will be used for membership and weekly fees. The membership fees will remain unchanged at $75. In addition, weekly fees are down $5 to $75 on the Wilmot, Alpine and Little Switzerland days and $95 on the Cascade/Chestnut days.</br> 

                        <br>We’ll start our 53rd Season on Saturday, December 2nd. Dates for the 2017-18 Season are:</br>
                              <br>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><b>Little Switzerland:</b> Dec 2nd, Jan 13th, Feb 3rd and Feb 24th</li>
                                  <li><b>Wilmot Mountain:</b> Dec 9th, Jan 6th, Jan 27th and March 10th</li>                         
                                  <li><b>Chestnut Mountain:</b> December 16th</li> 
                                  <li><b>Alpine Valley:</b> February 17th</li>
                                  <li><b>Cascade Mountain:</b> Jan 20th, Feb 10th, March 3rd and March 17th</li>
                                </ul>
                              </br>
                        <br>The Chestnut and Cascade trips will be from 6:30 AM – 7PM due to the longer distance. We're doing these pickups an hour earlier this year due to parent feedback as the 8PM return time was too long of a day for the kids. We will continue to have the main pick-up at Lyons School in Glenview (SE corner of Waukegan Rd and Lake Avenue) and TBD on additional pick-up points. We're not using the Winnetka pickup this year. Please check back for those locations as the first trip approaches.</br>

                        <br>Trips other than Chestnut and Cascade will be from 7:30 AM – 5:00 PM. Please try to have your kids at the locations by 7:15 AM and be on time at 5:00 PM for pickup.  
As always, we strive to have friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff at Scandinavian Ski Shop to ensure that your children’s skiing & snowboarding needs are taken care of during the winter season. 
We will be reaching out to everyone directly to explain the changes in more detail. Also, we’ll be planning a family ski trip so stay tuned for that information. We can be reached by calling the ski shop and/or at (224) 223-7542. As well as www.skiavalancheclub.com.</br>

                        <br>Thank you for your interest in the Trolls - Avalanche program!! Let’s all <b>THINK SNOW!!</b></br>
